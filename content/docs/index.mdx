title: John Paul
description: Full Stack Developer
---

I design, build, and optimise powerful web applications that solve real business challenges. With expertise in React, Next.js, Node.js, and modern databases, I craft tailored digital solutions that are scalable, efficient, and built for growth. Backed by five years in web development and a career leading global IT projects at IBM, Rolls-Royce, and Ericsson, I bring a strategic mindset to every project. From SaaS platforms to AI-driven applications, I turn complex ideas into seamless, high-performing systems.

I have created this site to describe my work from a more technical perspective. This is content that you would not usually share on public facing sites, where the audience would not usually be technical.

I will be including more projects, but have added just one of my most recent to this site for consideration.

I hope you find it useful in making your decision about hiring me.
