It is a Modern CRM Application with Enterprise-Grade Architecture. The application provides the following functionality:

- Role-Based Access Control
- Customer Management
- Service Management
- Document Management
- Project Management
- Task Management
- Reporting and Analytics

The purpose of the app is to provide a simple but effective way to manage clients and projects. There are many current SAAS offerings for this purpose, but I wanted to build my own to have full control over the data and the application. I wanted an application that only provided the core functionality of a CRM without the bloat and fluff.

The app is already built to add-on Stripe for payments and has a fully integrated email system.

The app is being built in 2 phases.

1. the core CRM functionality
2. the add-ons for payments, email, and integrations with other apps, such as OpenAI and Stripe. Replace authentication with Clerk or BetterAuth, upgrade to Next.js 15, and use React-Query for state management in complex client side components.

Phase 1 is in user acceptance with other freelancers. Once this is completed, it is likely I will rebuild the app to be more user friendly and add the additional features. I will also deploy React Testing Library and Cypress for end-to-end testing.

The current authentication is provided by Lucia Auth, which I have removed from the NPM modules and has being built directly into the app. I did this as after I chose Lucia, the author decided to deprecate the project. In phase 2 I will investigate if I should use Clerk or BetterAuth.

I will also likely use React-Query to handle the Trello like Project Board which is 'client heavy' and requires a lot of complex prop-drilling. React-Query would make it easier for state management, data fetching and caching.

The app utilises cutting-edge technologies and enterprise-level architectural patterns.

**Here's the Gig Canvas Architecture:**

## Core Technology Stack

- Next.js for server-side rendering and optimal performance
- TypeScript for type safety and enhanced developer experience
- Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first styling
- PostgreSQL with Supabase Database for serverless deployment
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Zustand for state management
- Zod for data validation
- Zod-actions for server actions
- HTML sanitization for security

## Security & Authentication

The application implements a robust, multi-layered security approach:

- Multi-provider authentication supporting Email, Google, and GitHub login
- Secure session management with HTTP-only cookies and proper CSRF protection
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with granular permissions
- Password hashing with proper salt implementation
- Environment-based security configurations
- A separate data-access layer for database operations

## data validation, type safety, and security using Zod, Zod-actions, and HTML sanitization

**Zod Implementation**

All form inputs are validated using Zod schemas, ensuring type safety and data validation at runtime
Custom error messages provide user-friendly feedback
Example schema implementation:

```ts
const ClientSchema = z.object({
  business_name: z.string().min(2).max(100),
  primary_email: z.string().email(),
  primary_phone: z.string().min(10),
  business_description: z.string().min(10).max(500),
  sales_stage: z.enum([
    'lead',
    'prospect',
    'qualified_opportunity',
    'proposal',
    'negotiation',
    'closed_won',
    'closed_lost'
  ]),
  date_onboarded: z.date(),
  annual_revenue_expected: z.string().optional(),
  additional_info: z.string().optional()
});
```

**Zod safe actions**

- Server actions are wrapped with Zod validation using the createServerAction pattern
- Type-safe communication between client and server
- Built-in authenticated validation and error handling and type inference

Example implementation:

```ts
export const createClientAction = authenticatedAction
  .createServerAction()
  .input(ClientSchema)
  .handler(async ({ input, user }) => {
    // Input is fully typed and validated
    const client = await createClientUseCase(user, input);
    return client;
  });
```

**Form Handling**

- React Hook Form integration with Zod for client-side validation
- Type inference from Zod schemas to form handlers

Example usage:

```ts
const form = useForm<z.infer<typeof ClientSchema>>({
  resolver: zodResolver(ClientSchema),
  defaultValues: {
    sales_stage: 'lead',
    date_onboarded: new Date()
  }
});
```

**HTML Sanitization**

- All user-generated content is sanitized before storage and display
- Prevention of XSS attacks through content sanitization

Implementation example:

```ts
const sanitizeHtml = (content: string) => {
  return DOMPurify.sanitize(content, {
    ALLOWED_TAGS: ['p', 'b', 'i', 'em', 'strong', 'a'],
    ALLOWED_ATTR: ['href']
  });
};

// Usage in form submission
const handleSubmit = async (data: FormData) => {
  const sanitizedDescription = sanitizeHtml(data.business_description);
  // Process sanitized content
};
```

**Type Safety Benefits**

- Complete type inference from schema to database
- Runtime validation matching TypeScript types
- Automatic error handling and type checking
- Reduced potential for runtime errors

**Error Handling**

- Custom error messages for validation failures
- Type-safe error handling across the application
- Consistent error format for frontend display

**This implementation ensures:**

- Data integrity through validation
- Type safety across the full stack
- Protection against XSS and injection attacks
- Consistent error handling
- Improved developer experience with full type inference

The combination of Zod, Zod-actions, and HTML sanitization creates a robust foundation for handling user input and maintaining application security.

## Database Architecture

The database layer demonstrates enterprise-level considerations

- Comprehensive schema design using Drizzle ORM
- Transaction management ensuring data integrity
- Audit logging system tracking all critical operations
- Optimized indexing for frequently accessed data
- Efficient connection pooling for scalability

## Clean Architecture & Code Quality

- Clear separation of concerns (data access, business logic, presentation)
- Type-safe operations throughout the entire stack
- Comprehensive error handling with custom error types
- Consistent coding patterns and style
- Modular component architecture

## Scalability Considerations

- Efficient database transaction handling
- Clear separation of concerns for future expansion
- Modular architecture allowing for easy feature additions

This application demonstrates not just technical proficiency but an understanding of enterprise software architecture, security best practices, and scalable application design. The implementation shows careful consideration of both current requirements and future scalability needs.
